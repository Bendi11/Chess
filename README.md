# Chess
The version of chess I made in C++. My goal is to make some kind of chess AI or engine to play against, 
so I took some extra care making everything in the Chess namespace easy to interface with, so that I didn't have the added 
complexity of a hard to use game on top of the challenge of making some kind of engine. That being said, I can almost guarantee that any chess library 
will offer way better performance / ease of use than my chess game. I hope to release the game as a compiled exe / apk / linux executable once all the 
features are in place and most of the bugs have been squashed. 

## Features:
- [x] Mouse controlled piece movement
- [x] Multiplayer over LAN with socket connections
- [ ] Configurable themes
- [x] Enemy engine with varying levels of skill to face against
- [ ] Enemy AI with varying levels of skill that learns from the player
